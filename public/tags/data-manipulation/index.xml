      <description>Data wrangling sometimes could become very tedious. No matter what language do you prefer: R, python, or even SQL, the process of preprocessing your dataset is generally very time consuming. But, this is not the case if you know how to properly use packages included in tidyverse.

      <description>1. SetupLibraries and SetupWe’ll set-up caching for this notebook given how computationally expensive some of the code we will write can get.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)options(scipen = 9999)rm(list=ls())You will need to use install.packages() to install any packages that are not already downloaded onto your machine. You then load the package into your workspace using the library() function:
library(tidyverse)## Warning: package &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.</description>
